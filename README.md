I'm **Javier Diaz** (coderdiaz) — a Software Engineer with experience in product design crafting high-performance digital experiences. With deep expertise in design systems and Jamstack architecture, I bridge the gap between elegant design and robust engineering.

I specialize in building lightning-fast, accessible products that solve real user problems. My work combines technical excellence with human-centered design principles, focusing on:

- Design Systems & Component Architecture
- User Experience & Interface Design
- Modern Frontend & Backend solutions

Currently helping teams deliver intuitive digital products that scale. Let's build something remarkable together.

- 🔭 Currently, I'm crafting a **software for dance studios** called Kobi and will be available soon for iOS and Android.
- 🌱 Learning about **Product Design, Animations** and **Golang**.
- 💬 Feel free to ask me about **web development** or specific tech stacks like Node, Nest.js, React, Strapi, and GraphQL.
- 🚀 Have a project related to design or development? Reach out via email.
- 📫 How to reach me: [@coderdiaz](https://x.com/coderdiaz) on X.com or send me an email to hey[at]coderdiaz.com.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him.
- 📺 Join me on [Twitch](https://coderdiaz.com/live) for exciting streams somedays!

I share my journey in tech through writing — documenting insights, experiences, and learnings from the trenches of software development. While I may not be a professional writer, I believe in the power of sharing knowledge openly.
